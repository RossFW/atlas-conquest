# Data Model

> Defines the JSON data contracts between the pipeline (`scripts/`) and the frontend (`site/`).
> Schema TBD — will be populated once we explore the AWS database.

## Data Files

All files live in `site/data/` and are generated by the pipeline.

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `metadata.json` | Last updated timestamp, data version | Planned |
| `cards.json` | Card definitions (name, faction, type, stats, keywords) | Planned |
| `commanders.json` | Commander definitions and attributes | Planned |
| `matches.json` | Match history (players, decks, commanders, winner, duration) | Planned |
| `card_stats.json` | Aggregated card analytics (play rate, winrate) | Planned |
| `commander_stats.json` | Commander winrates, matchup matrix | Planned |
| `deck_archetypes.json` | Deck clustering and meta breakdown | Planned |
| `trends.json` | Time-series data for meta shifts | Planned |

## Schema Definitions

> To be defined after exploring the AWS database schema.

### metadata.json
```json

  "last_updated": "2026-02-21T06:00:00Z",
  "total_matches": 0,
  "total_players": 0,
  "data_version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### cards.json (expected shape)

> Remaining schemas will be filled in once we understand the raw data structure from AWS.
